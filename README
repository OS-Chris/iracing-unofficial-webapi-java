An unofficial API for iRacing web services for active members.

This was part of something I was working on a year or so back. Most of what's already coded works (well it did back then), but there is still some missing functionality.

I don't have time at this stage to complete this project but I encourage you guys/gals to fork this project and implement the remaining stuff. Ports to other languages shouldn't be too hard after studying IracingWebApi.java

Please use sparingly as it creates extra load on iRacings servers and if you abuse the system, you may just find yourself banned for some period of time.
